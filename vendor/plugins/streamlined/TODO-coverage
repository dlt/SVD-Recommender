Why not all the code is covered, and what you can do about it:

* render_helper: needs to be merged with relevance tools implementation
* integration_tests: generic test code, had some trouble getting this to run inside Streamlined sans Rails
* window_link_helper: need to refactor to unobtrusive JavaScript (also begs question of acceptance testing for JavaScript)
* integration_test_support: same as integration_tests
* relationship_methods: code that only Justin understands
* quick_add_methods: new code, should be easy
* edit_views: simple
* controller_test_support: see integration_tests
* reflection: code needs refactoring
* render_methods: simple
* helper: simple, might need refactoring
* controller: very difficult to mock!
* base: code is incomplete

When you get coverage up, make sure the feature covered is demoed in sports and documented in the wiki.
